Welcome to my Writing Den.</p><p>Here you will find a blog about my novel <strong><em>Galactic Consequences</em></strong> and other short stories I wrote such as <strong><em>A Witchy Best Friend</em></strong> you can find my <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/ >ScribbleHub Profile</a> where my novels are published.</p><h2 id=gc><a href=#gc class=anchor></a>Galactic Consequences (GC)</h2><p><em>GC</em> is my main story, it’s still in the writing phase (of my first draft, though I edit as I write) so it won’t appear on the shelves <em>just yet</em> but it will! The PDF/Web Novel will be free to read on <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com>ScribbleHub</a>, as well as <a href=https://fluff4.me/ >Fluff</a>.</p><p>I’m currently finishing Chapter VII out of fifteen with an epilogue. Each chapters are between 2,500 and 3,000 words long, so the whole book will be around 40,000 words long. So we can consider the first draft of Galactic Consequences to be between 40 and 50% done.</p><p>You can read (and really should!) the <a href=/blog/ >blog</a> for updates on <em>GC</em>!</p><h2 id=epic-battle><a href=#epic-battle class=anchor></a>An Epic Battle</h2><p><em>An Epic Battle</em> is a sweet short story about a girl and an AI, playing tennis, and developing feelings.</p><p>It is in the same universe as AWB and Roommates (the <em>witchy-verse</em>) but the date is unspecified.</p><p>You can find the files (PDF,EPUB,Sources) <a href=/epic_battle>here</a>. Or you can find it on <a href="">Fluff</a> or <a href="">ScribbleHub</a></p><h2 id=roommates><a href=#roommates class=anchor></a>Roommates (My Roommates Suddenly Became My Girlfriends)</h2><p><em>Roommate</em> is the name I use for the very-long title of the short story <em>My roommates suddenly became my girlfriends</em>. It’s a silly eggfic in the same universe as <a href=#awb2024>A Witchy Best Friend 2024</a>, it involves a cis guy and his five roommates, one after the other they become girls, and they want to date him. While telling him he can ask to be a girl…</p><p>Some familiar faces come back, and it drops some important lore on the Universe of AWB, GC, and Roommates. Which I’m considering calling the witchy-verse lol. So get to read, you can find the files for the PDF <a href=/roommates/ >here</a>. Or you can read it on <a href=https://fluff4.me/work/vanilla-extracts/roommates>Fluff</a> or <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com/series/1683056/my-roommates-suddenly-became-my-girlfriends/ >ScribbleHub</a>.</p><h2 id=awb2024><a href=#awb2024 class=anchor></a>A Witchy Best Friend 2024</h2><p>I rewrote <em>AWB</em>. It will be uploaded to ScribbleHub over the coming days, but you already access all relevant files <a href=/awb2024/ >here</a></p><p>The rewriting is <em>much better</em> than the original. I am a better writer than when I uploaded the first one, but the original will stay up for the nostalgia of a beginner :).</p><p>Do give a try on Scribble, download the epub or PDF (I put a lot of love into the <em>Typst</em> template of the PDF so try it too!) and even the source file (for.. whatever reasons but hey it is open source so you do what ever you want)</p><p>It’s not perfect and I received a lot of constructive criticism over it, allowing me to apply them for better results in the short stories and more importantly in the novel itself.</p><h2 id=awb><a href=#awb class=anchor></a>A Witchy Best Friend</h2><p><em>AWB</em> is a short story I wrote years ago, it is rough, but sweet enough to be maintained. You can find it on <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com/series/427680/a-witchy-best-friend/ >ScribbleHub</a></p><p>You can find the files <a href=/awb/ >here</a>. But stick around a while longer and see about the <a href=#awb2024>2024 version</a>!</p><h2 id=support-me><a href=#support-me class=anchor></a>Support me</h2><p>If you fancy supporting me, first <em>thank you very much</em>, second, I am not a full time writer, my day job is in IT. So consider giving the money to a struggling writer. If you <em>really</em> fancy supporting me though you can buy the e-book (starting at €5, with an optional donation) on my <a href=https://ko-fi.com/vanilla_extracts>Ko-Fi Shop</a> or on <a href=https://itch.io>itch</a> <strong>once it will be done.</strong></p><p>If you <strong>really</strong> want to support my work, five copies of <em>GC</em> will be sold at <em>€50</em> each. You will find it on the Ko-Fi shop, when available.</p><p>Most of the profits generated by the book will be used to commission artists for amazing artworks!</p><h2 id=font><a href=#font class=anchor></a>Font</h2><p>This website uses the <a href=https://monaspace.githubnext.com>Monaspace Neon</a> font.
