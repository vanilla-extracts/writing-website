Welcome to my Writing Den.</p><p>Here you will find a blog about my novel <em>Galactic Consequences</em> and other short stories I wrote such as <em>A Witchy Best Friend</em> you can find my <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/ >ScribbleHub Profile</a> where my novels are published.</p><h2 id=gc><a href=#gc class=anchor></a>Galactic Consequences</h2><p><em>GC</em> is my main story, it’s still in the writing phase (of my first draft) so it won’t appear on the shelves <em>just yet</em> but it will! The PDF/Web Novel will be free to read on <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com>ScribbleHub</a>.</p><p>You can read the <a href=/blog/ >blog</a> for updates on <em>GC</em>!</p><h2 id=awb><a href=#awb class=anchor></a>A Witchy Best Friend</h2><p><em>AWB</em> is a short story I wrote years ago, it is rough, but sweet enough to be maintained. You can find it on <a href=https://www.scribblehub.com/series/427680/a-witchy-best-friend/ >ScribbleHub</a></p><p>You can find the files <a href=/awb/ >here</a>. But stick around a while longer and see about the <a href=#awb2024>2024 version</a>!</p><h2 id=awb2024><a href=#awb2024 class=anchor></a>A Witchy Best Friend 2024</h2><p>I rewrote <em>AWB</em>. It will be uploaded to ScribbleHub over the coming days, but you already access all relevant files <a href=/awb2024/ >here</a></p><p>The rewriting is <em>much better</em> than the original. I am a better writer than when I uploaded the first one, but the original will stay up for the nostalgia of a beginner :).</p><p>Do give a try on Scribble, download the epub or PDF (I put a lot of love into the <em>Typst</em> template of the PDF so try it too!) and even the source file (for.. whatever reasons but hey it is open source so you do what ever you want)</p><h2 id=support-me><a href=#support-me class=anchor></a>Support me</h2><p>If you fancy supporting me, first <em>thank you very much</em>, second, I am not a full time writer, my day job is in IT. So consider giving the money to a struggling writer. If you <em>really</em> fancy supporting me though you can buy the e-book (starting at €5, with an optional donation) on my <a href=https://ko-fi.com/vanilla_extracts>Ko-Fi Shop</a> or on <a href=https://itch.io>itch</a> once it will be done.</p><p>If you <strong>really</strong> want to support my work, five copies of <em>GC</em> will be sold at <em>€50</em> each. You will find it on the Ko-Fi shop.</p><p>Most of the profits generated by the book will be used to commission artists for amazing artworks!</p><h2 id=about-me><a href=#about-me class=anchor></a>About Me</h2><p>I am using she/they pronouns and feminine accords.</p><p>You can find my <a href=https://www.charlotte-thomas.me>website</a> here, this is only the write log</p><p>You can find me there:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts>GitHub, as vanilla-extracts</a></li><li>Discord, as <code class=scode>vanilla_extracts</code></li><li>Email regarding my writing, at <code class=scode>gc [at] charlotte-thomas [dot] me</code></li><li>General Email, at <code class=scode>me [at] charlotte-thomas [dot] me</code></li><li>Threads/IG, as <code class=scode>vanilla.extracts</code></li><li><a href=https://ko-fi.com/vanilla_extracts>Ko-Fi as vanilla_extracts</a></li></ul></main><footer class=center><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
