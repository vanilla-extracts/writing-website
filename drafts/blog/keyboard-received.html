But it means it’s the end of the break, and I will start writing again!</p><h2 id=ironic><a href=#ironic class=anchor></a>Ironic, I know</h2><p>Unfortunately I received this keyboard on a Thursday, I needed the whole day to configure it, and swapping some keys and switches (yeah, I put a single green heavy clicky switch on my Enter key, my Enter key is extra clicky. It’s very satisfying.)</p><p>Anyway, I’m off to my parents’ house on Saturday morning. So I will have my laptop obviously and I <em>will</em> be writing. With the amazing keyboard of the Framework 13. It’s just funny that I won’t be writing Chapter V with my new keyboard <em>for which I took a break</em>.</p><h2 id=eta><a href=#eta class=anchor></a>ETA</h2><p>I’m not trying to put me a deadline but I think I will have a finished chapter by mid-March. I sincerely hope so at least. Chapter V starts to be interesting as fuck, and it gets <em>nerdy</em> as <strong>heck</strong>.</p><p>Seriously if you like nerdy things, you will <em>love</em> the book, at least I think so. It’s very nerdy. I will write advanced, complex, complete, info-dump on computer science, protocols, teleportation, FTL, weapons, some galactic politics the whole nine yards.</p><p>Be ready~~</p><h2 id=wtf><a href=#wtf class=anchor></a>But Charlotte You Didn’t Tell Us Which Keyboard You Got???</h2><p>It’s the Keychron K4 Pro QMK, in ISO FR. With brown switches. That’s all.</p><p>It’s the end of my setup, which is the following:</p><ul><li>Framework 13, Ryzen 5 7640U, 32GB of RAM<ul><li>Fedora 41</li><li>Hyprland</li><li>Fish</li><li>Alacritty</li><li>Nvim</li></ul></li><li>Dell 1440p 144Hz 27 inches monitor</li><li>Keychron K4 Pro QMK</li><li>Apple Magic Trackpad.</li></ul><p>Yes, I’m non-ironically using a magic trackpad. It’s <em>amazing</em>. I love trackpads, and all I do is coding and writing sooo…</p><p>Stellaris is giving me the side eyes, I’m just not sure I can actually run it without a dedicated GPU, even if the 7640U GPU cores are pretty advanced <em>for APUs</em>.</p><p>It would be the first video game I play in literal <em>years</em> I haven’t touched my last game (KSP) since 2021.</p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/writing-website class=no_underline><img alt="GitHub Logo"height=24 src=/static/github.svg width=auto></a><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
