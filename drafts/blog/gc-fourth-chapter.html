I sent it to the alpha-readers for their thoughts on it.</p><p>It took a while! Almost a month and a half, but I had writer’s block!</p><p>My favourite quote of the chapter</p><blockquote><p>Aendir looked uneasy, and sighed “… Okay you can come, but we’re staying on Earth!”</p></blockquote><p>It officially marks the 25% completion of the book, with 4 chapters out of 16. This is exciting!</p><p>Stay tuned for <em>Chapter V: Exploration</em> (yeah you can guess the quote won’t stay true with a chapter name like this can you?)</p><h2 id=writer><a href=#writer class=anchor></a>Writer’s block</h2><p>So, why was I having a case of writer’s block? I don’t know, my muse was cooperating with my Star Trek RP but I needed more than a month of rest before being able to take the quill and attack this chapter.</p><p>I am quite happy with how it turned out and I managed to hyperfix and worldbuild with my partner so we have an entire race of	<em>mysterious</em> beings with a backstory.</p><p>I’m not revealing who are they though you’ll have to wait for the chapter to be released!</p><p><strong>EDIT 2025-01-24:</strong> Add a little more on the blog entry</p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
