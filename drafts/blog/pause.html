This is a big blog post.</p><p>I spent a lot of money kitting myself with a new laptop (Framework 13), a new keyboard (Keychron K4 Pro Brown), a new trackpad (the magic trackpad, which is absolutely awesome and works out of the box in Linux).</p><p>I also upgraded my automatic syntax, context and grammar corrector and spellchecker.</p><p>I world-built a lot in the last few weeks, I have the armaments figured out, and half the FTL drive done. I need to think a bit more on FTL and figure out relative speed (which will be vague as to try to avoid issues, I learned from Star Trek).</p><p>I’m going to pause the novel for the next 20 to 30 days until I receive the new keyboard though. I’ll continue world-building, I’ll continue thinking about it but no more writing of Chapter V for now. It’s gonna be a short pause, it’s not like I was rushing to publish this book or anything I want a polished stone not a raw diamond.</p><p>I’m kinda sure no one reads this blog anyway, but if you do, expect a return in 20 to 30 days and a chapter one to two weeks after that. I’ll publish an update when I start to write again and of course I’ll continue to write my usual chapter news in the blog.</p><h2 id=progress><a href=#progress class=anchor></a>Progress</h2><p>Everything I say here is to take with a heavy sodium chloride grain, I write at my own pace, for my own enjoyment, so no promise! I said last time I am about 25% done on the writing and first round of editing.</p><p>I expect I will have finished the novel and first round of editing in about half a year (up to a year though, we never know). Then I’ll have a look and harmonise the stuff (because the writing style may change in a year and I’d like to stay consistent, thankfully I have my notes for the plot to stay consistent on the plot).</p><p>After that I’ll send it to a few beta readers, most of them are native English speakers as well as seasoned writers, so they’ll be able to spot issues within the book, writing style, plot and story-telling. I cannot estimate how much time this step will take, particularly because it depends on availability of the beta-readers, but I expect it to last no less than a quarter of a year.</p><p>Then it’ll be the final touches and the chapters will start being published to</p><ul><li>ScribbleHub</li><li>AO3</li><li>RoyalRoad</li></ul><p>At a rate of one a week, for sixteen weeks until the epilogue, the e-book will be available the whole time, at a floating price, you name your own price above €5. Purchases will be on itch and Ko-Fi, no Amazon overlord.</p><p>The physical books <em>may</em> be coming once the novel will be fully published on SH, AO3, and RR. It will likely be a small run.</p><h2 id=art><a href=#art class=anchor></a>Art</h2><p>I started talks to commission the cover and back-cover art, I expect to have them before the novel starts its publication.</p><p>I currently have no ideas about character’s arts, ship’s art, etc. I want to have them but it will depend on funds and the publication of the book lines up with me buying an apartment, so I’ll likely be low on funds.</p><p>I will keep you updated.</p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
