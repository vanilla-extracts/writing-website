## Charlotte Thomas' Writing Den { #den } 

Hi! Welcome to my Writing Den.

Here you will find a blog about my novel **_Galactic Consequences_** and other short
stories I wrote such as **_A Witchy Best Friend_** you can find my [ScribbleHub
Profile](https://www.scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/) where my novels are published.

## Galactic Consequences (GC) { #gc }

_GC_ is my main story, it's still in the writing phase (of my first draft, though I edit as I write) so it
won't appear on the shelves *just yet* but it will! The PDF/Web Novel will be
free to read on [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com), as well as [Fluff](https://fluff4.me/).

I'm currently finishing Chapter VII out of fifteen with an epilogue. Each chapters are between 2,500 and 3,000 words long, so the whole book will be around 40,000 words long.
So we can consider the first draft of Galactic Consequences to be between 40 and 50% done.

You can read (and really should!) the [blog](/blog/) for updates on _GC_!

## Roommates (My Roommates Suddenly Became My Girlfriends) {#roommates}

_Roommate_ is the name I use for the very-long title of the short story _My roommates suddenly became my girlfriends_.
It's a silly eggfic in the same universe as [A Witchy Best Friend 2024](#awb2024), it involves a cis guy and his five roommates,
one after the other they become girls, and they want to date him. While telling him he can ask to be a girl...

Some familiar faces come back, and it drops some important lore on the Universe of AWB, GC, and Roommates. Which I'm considering calling the witchy-verse lol.
So get to read, you can find the files for the PDF [here](/roommates/). Or you can read it on [Fluff](https://fluff4.me/work/vanilla-extracts/roommates)
or [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/1683056/my-roommates-suddenly-became-my-girlfriends/). 

## A Witchy Best Friend 2024 { #awb2024 }

I rewrote _AWB_. It will be uploaded to ScribbleHub over the coming days, but
you already access all relevant files [here](/awb2024/)

The rewriting is _much better_ than the original. I am a better writer than when
I uploaded the first one, but the original will stay up for the nostalgia of a
beginner :).

Do give a try on Scribble, download the epub or PDF (I put a lot of love into
the _Typst_ template of the PDF so try it too!) and even the source file (for..
whatever reasons but hey it is open source so you do what ever you want)

It's not perfect and I received a lot of constructive criticism over it, allowing me to apply them for better results in the short stories and more importantly in the novel itself.

## A Witchy Best Friend { #awb }

_AWB_ is a short story I wrote years ago, it is rough, but sweet enough to be
maintained. You can find it on [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/427680/a-witchy-best-friend/)

You can find the files [here](/awb/). But stick around a while longer and see
about the [2024 version](#awb2024)!

## Support me { #support-me }

If you fancy supporting me, first *thank you very much*, second, I am not a full
time writer, my day job is in IT. So consider giving the money to a struggling
writer. If you *really* fancy supporting me though you can buy the e-book
(starting at €5, with an optional donation) on my [Ko-Fi
Shop](https://ko-fi.com/vanilla_extracts) or on [itch](https://itch.io) **once it will be
done.**

If you **really** want to support my work, five copies of _GC_ will be sold at
_€50_ each. You will find it on the Ko-Fi shop, when available. 

Most of the profits generated by the book will be used to commission artists for
amazing artworks!
