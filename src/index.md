## Charlotte Thomas' Writing Den { #den } 

Hi! Welcome to my Writing Den.

Here you will find a blog about my novel _Galactic Consequences_ and other short
stories I wrote such as _A Witchy Best Friend_ you can find my [ScribbleHub
Profile](https://www.scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/) where my novels are published.

## Galactic Consequences { #gc }

_GC_ is my main story, it's still in the writing phase (of my first draft) so it
won't appear on the shelves *just yet* but it will! The PDF/Web Novel will be
free to read on [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com). 

You can read the [blog](/blog/) for updates on _GC_!

## A Witchy Best Friend { #awb }

_AWB_ is a short story I wrote years ago, it is rough, but sweet enough to be
maintained. You can find it on [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/427680/a-witchy-best-friend/)

You can find the files [here](/awb/). But stick around a while longer and see
about the [2024 version](#awb2024)!

## A Witchy Best Friend 2024 { #awb2024 }

I rewrote _AWB_. It will be uploaded to ScribbleHub over the coming days, but
you already access all relevant files [here](/awb2024/)

The rewriting is _much better_ than the original. I am a better writer than when
I uploaded the first one, but the original will stay up for the nostalgia of a
beginner :).

Do give a try on Scribble, download the epub or PDF (I put a lot of love into
the _Typst_ template of the PDF so try it too!) and even the source file (for..
whatever reasons but hey it is open source so you do what ever you want)

## Support me { #support-me }

If you fancy supporting me, first *thank you very much*, second, I am not a full
time writer, my day job is in IT. So consider giving the money to a struggling
writer. If you *really* fancy supporting me though you can buy the e-book
(starting at €5, with an optional donation) on my [Ko-Fi
Shop](https://ko-fi.com/vanilla_extracts) or on [itch](https://itch.io) once it will be
done.

If you **really** want to support my work, five copies of _GC_ will be sold at
_€50_ each. You will find it on the Ko-Fi shop. 

Most of the profits generated by the book will be used to commission artists for
amazing artworks!
