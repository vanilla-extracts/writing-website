# Fifth chapter finished and edited
## Chapter V {#chapter}
I am happy to announce that Chapter V is finished, and I did the first and
second pass of editing as well!

On the last blog post I said it was going to be a chonky chapter, but in the end
I decided to finish the second part of the chapter I had in mind in _Chapter
VI_. 

It was to avoid risking having a chapter with five thousand words and the next
barely being two thousand.

So the proper _exploration_ will happen in _Chapter VI: Fugitives_. I know, the
title is \~spooky\~ but do not be afraid! Everything will be fine, I am not
cruel to my character and this is *overall* a feel-good novel.

But we need a bit of drama!

## Sneak Peak {#sneak}
I know you already got a peak with the last blog entry, but I will give you
another one! 

> The only answer he received was a happy *beep*. Can a *beep* be happy? Apparently.

See you for _Chapter VI: Fugitives_.
