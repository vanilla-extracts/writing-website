# Analgesia, a new domain for my writing hobby
## Move {#move}
So, if you follow this blog (first of all, what the hell, like, why?) you would be able to see all links now point to `analgesia.icu/*`

[The old URL (writing.charlotte-thomas.me)] still works to access the website and even see the RSS flux, which I'm sure exactly 0 people are subscribed to (do not lie, you're not there, I'm the only one reading, and writing.) but all internal links points to `analsia.icu` as the new domain.

## Why... {#why}
You could ask
> Why? Why? Analgesia? It has nothing to do with writing!?

And you'd be right, but when I saw (for totally normal reason) that `analgesia.icu` was available I jumped on it. Why? Well to quote my own blog article from my main blog a few minutes ago
> Mostly because (Painkillers) (Dot) (Intensive Care Unit) was too much fun to pass.

I asked on the [fediverse](https://woof.tech/@vanilla_extract) (the [exact toot was this one](https://woof.tech/@vanilla_extract/115304504874238722)) what to do with my awesome new domain and someone just said to use it for one of my hobbies, and writing is currently my *only* hobby beside.. well work.

So I did it! Everything is under [`analgesia.icu`](https://analgesia.icu), by the way [`www.analgesia.icu`](https://www.analgesia.icu) also works.

## Future {#future}
I want to do some fun things with this domain, my next likely project will be to add an online static reader for my stories, probably something like [`reader.analgesia.icu`](https://reader.analgesia.icu), to be clear it doesn't exist yet. Or I may do something funnier like [`cuddy.analgesia.icu`](https://cuddy.analgesia.icu) because I like House, MD. Or something else, [just contact me](mailto:me@charlotte-thomas.me) if you have any ideas.
