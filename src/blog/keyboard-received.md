# Keyboard received
## Keyboard received, end of break {#kb}
Helloooo,
I received my Keyboard and it is amaaazing, I'm still learning it, adjusting my
muscle-memory for it to work. But it means it's the end of the break, and I will
start writing again! 

## Ironic, I know {#ironic}
Unfortunately I received this keyboard on a Thursday, I needed the whole day to
configure it, and swapping some keys and switches (yeah, I put a single green
heavy clicky switch on my Enter key, my Enter key is extra clicky. It's very
satisfying.)

Anyway, I'm off to my parents' house on Saturday morning. So I will have my
laptop obviously and I *will* be writing. With the amazing keyboard of the
Framework 13. It's just funny that I won't be writing Chapter V with my new
keyboard *for which I took a break*.

## ETA {#eta}
I'm not trying to put me a deadline but I think I will have a finished chapter
by mid-March. I sincerely hope so at least. Chapter V starts to be interesting
as fuck, and it gets *nerdy* as **heck**. 

Seriously if you like nerdy things, you will *love* the book, at least I think
so. It's very nerdy. I will write advanced, complex, complete, info-dump on
computer science, protocols, teleportation, FTL, weapons, some galactic politics
the whole nine yards.

Be ready~~

## But Charlotte You Didn't Tell Us Which Keyboard You Got??? {#wtf}
It's the Keychron K4 Pro QMK, in ISO FR. With brown switches. That's all.

It's the end of my setup, which is the following:
- Framework 13, Ryzen 5 7640U, 32GB of RAM
	- Fedora 41 
	- Hyprland
	- Fish
	- Alacritty
	- Nvim
- Dell 1440p 144Hz 27 inches monitor
- Keychron K4 Pro QMK
- Apple Magic Trackpad.

Yes, I'm non-ironically using a magic trackpad. It's *amazing*. I love
trackpads, and all I do is coding and writing sooo...

Stellaris is giving me the side eyes, I'm just not sure I can actually run it
without a dedicated GPU, even if the 7640U GPU cores are pretty advanced *for
APUs*.

It would be the first video game I play in literall *years* I haven't touched my
last game (KSP) since 2021.
