# Announcing new short story: My roommates suddenly turned into my girlfriends (Working Title)

## Roommates {#roommates}
I have... yet another project. It's cute and silly the name may change but the current working title is:

**My roommates suddenly turned into my girlfriends**

It's in the same setting as *A Witchy Best Friend (2024)* and takes place in the 2070s decade. It follows a perfectly cishet boy named Gordon. One day one of his roommates turned into a girl. 

She explains she just had to email `transform@magic` and explain what she wanted to do.

Then shenanigans begets shenanigans.

It's a cute little short story. And some regulars might show up. 

It's a story where one find herself, and maybe love. Pretty much in the same vibe as AWB, if a little flashier.

## Synopsis {#synopsis} 
Gordon is a good guy. He doesn't work - thanks for UBI - he is a good university student, gets good grades. 

He sometimes has some dates but he always feels weird.

One day one of his roommates suddenly turn into a girl after an email. It's far more powerful than even the best Antarctican Tech Mages can do.

Follow Gordon as he discovers a strange new world and a part of himself he never thought existed.

## Chapters {#chapters}
The story has four chapters, and an epilogue.

1. Chapter 1: My roommate is suddenly a girl.
2. Chapter 2: Of course, all my roommates followed.
3. Chapter 3: Somehow we're all a polycule now.
4. Chapter 4: Some of them have a tail.
5. Epilogue: Alicia.
