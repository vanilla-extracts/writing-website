# Update to AWB 2024
## Update {#update}
Hey! I followed a [blog post](https://www.howtogeek.com/run-your-own-private-grammarly-clone-using-docker-and-languagetool/) to create my own instance of LanguageTool to have a semantic, grammar, spell, and contextual checker for english and french.

I ran AWB through it and uploaded the correct version to the website
