# Flash Fiction: Lise's Adventure
## Publication {#pub}
Hey! I wrote a really short story (a little over one thousand words), with a really nice play on the concept of narrator, you can read it [on Fluff](https://fluff4.me/work/vanilla-extracts/lise-adventures) or [on ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/2132634/flash-fiction-lises-adventure/).
