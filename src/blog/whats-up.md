# What's Up?
## Long time no see {#long}
Hey, I know it's been more than three weeks since I've given signs of life.

I am working on the novel and the short story, but I have to admit it's long and
I am struggling with motivation these days, I have a busy time at work with the
current project and I'm starting my new assignment soon -- and I have to move
halfway accross the country.

## State of affairs {#affairs}

The current chapter of GC being written (Chapter VI: Fugitives) is about halfway
done but havn't been touched in a couple weeks.

The silly short story I refer as "Roommates" (because the working title is so
long). Is two chapters out of five done. These are smaller chapters, a little
above a thousand words a chapter, contrast to GC chapter which are about three
thousands words a chapter. I just finished chapter two today.

## The immediate future {#future}

On the immediate future, May will probably be a complete write-off, between the
move, the new assignment at my job, and my anxiety.

But I *should* be able to finish _Chapter VI: Fugitives_ of GC by mid June, again, no
promise, but I should be able to. Again, like the others I'll send it to my beta
readers and start on _Chapter VII_ (not gonna title drop ;)). 

In the meantime I'll finish _Roommates_ and send it up to some friends for beta
reading and then publish it on the usual suspects (so, SH, RR, AO3, and maybe
here if I _finally_ finished the online reader).


Cheers,

Charlotte.
