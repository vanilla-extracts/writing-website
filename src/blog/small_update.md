# A small update 
## What is going on {#what}
So, you can see we are about halfway through March, and I haven't given many
signs of life. 

I had problems IRL, and I was busy comforting myself doing other things (like
changing my whole config to use [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), a
wonderful new WM for Wayland.)

You can go see my dotfiles on the [git repo](https://git.charlotte-thomas.me/vanilla-extracts/.files)

But that's not important.

## Status of the chapter {#status}
This chapter is going to be _big_. I am already around 2,500 words on it and I
haven't written like half of it. So I accepted that this chapter was going to be
a chonky boi, as such it will have a chonky deadline (this is totally an excuse
to report the deadline, I'm the writer and you're not even reading this so who
cares right?) 

I think I'll be done by the end of March. And Hopefully I can do Chapter VI in
April.

## Status IRL {#irl}
May will be a big month, I'm moving halfway accross the country for my next (and
hopefully permanent) assignement with my job. I'll start doing my job as a
DevOps Engineer (which is a cool name to say a whole lot of nothing) there.

I don't think I will be able to write much in May. But I think I'll have Chapter
VII in the works to be finished in June.

## Roadmap {#roadmap}
From there it's just a matter of finishing the Chapters VIII to XVI, and the
epilogue, and like I said earlier in another post, from there it will be
editors, alpha readers, and all that jazzy stuff.

I'm _very_ not ready to announce a date and I don't even *want* to. Because it'd
pressure myself; and thus no date announced, it will happen when it happens.

## Sneakpeak {#sp}
Ok I'm not a monster I will give you a good quote from the first part of Chapter
V, not my *favourite* because on the off-chance someone reads this blog. First
of all thank you? Really I thought this was my blog and mine alone so wow. Cool.

Right, on the off-chance someone is reading this I don't want them to be spoiled
of the delight of reading my favourite sentence in the chapter, but enjoy a
sneakpeak.
