# Back to write
## Writing again {#again}
Hey!

I am back to write again, I almost finish writing the sixth chapter, it will certainly need _a lot of editing_; it has action, and I'm not good at writing action.
But I'm back! And hopefully it will not take me months to finish it and I'll be able to keep a rhythm again.

See you soon,

Cheers,

Charlotte Thomas
