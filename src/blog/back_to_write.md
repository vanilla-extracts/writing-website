# Back to write
## Chapter VI finished {#c6}
I am back to write again, I finished writing the sixth chapter, it will certainly need _a lot of editing_; it has action, and I'm not good at writing action.


It's good, I like it, but as I said it will need some editing to shine. And yes, I *might* have flirted with the fourth wall. But I guess you will have to wait
until it is released to see it ;).


## Sneak Peak {#peak}
As usual here is a sneak peak at the chapter.

> “It is indeed, I never get tired of seeing this” Aendir said smiling on the Captain’s chair. It was suspiciously similar to the Captain’s chair from a Star Trek show

See you around for _Chapter VII: Tinkering_

Cheers,

Charlotte Thomas
