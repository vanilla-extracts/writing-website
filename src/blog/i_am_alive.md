# I'm still alive!
## Vacations, progress. {#vacation}
Hello!

I was on vacation all summer (well I was on vacation from work in August but I took a leave from writing for the two months of summer). But I am proud to
announce work on Chapter VIII of *Galactic Consequences* has resumed.

I spent a lot of time on myself, getting therapy sessions and getting a psychiatrist back. I also adopted a cat, I'll post about her in my general blog
[here](https://charlotte-thomas.me/blog), she's anxious but I am happy to have her.

I am happy to write again, and no promises but I hope to finish this chapter soon-ish so I can start onto the next one. Chapter VII was exhausting emotionally and Chapter VIII is even more so.

Cheers.
