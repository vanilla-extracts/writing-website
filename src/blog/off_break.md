# Back to work, getting off break
## Break {#break}
If you follow this blog (which I know no one is actually following), you would see that I haven't made progress on writing for a few months.

For the past three months I was on medical leave, I focused on healing. However, I am starting work again (part time) in January, and with that I will start writing again.

The break was important for my mental and physical health.

## What the hell is wrong with you {#you}
I have multiple chronic illnesses, including CFS caused by Long EBV and Long COVID, and I have mental health issues, I was focusing on getting better so I could work again.

The holidays have been good for me, and I'm looking forward to start working again. I have so many ideas for the book and how to improve it, I even have sketches of the vessel used by our protagonists, the *Union Science Ship AIX-09*
I will include these sketches at the end of this article. They are merely concept sketches for my head to concentrate, I have aphantasia and thus I am unable to form voluntary mental images, so I had to get on paper. Unfortunately, I am a scientist and not a skilled artist, so they are simple.

## Galactic Consequences {#gc}
I will start writing *Galactic Consequences* again, and will try to focus and avoid branching on different stories, I already wrote two short stories on the same setting and I would really like to finish the first draft mid-2026. We'll see if I am able to do that.

I will start by editing what I already wrote to correct the descriptions of the ship to correlate to the sketches I made. And another round of editing will not hurt as well. When I have finished I will start by resuming Chapter VIII. There are fifteen chapters in total so I am about halfway through the first draft, and I edit as I write.

I hope to have news for you (read: finishing chapter VIII) by the middle of February, finishing in January will be tough as I have many medical visits literally at opposite cities in my country.

## Afterwords {#afterwords}
I hope you enjoy those sneak peaks at the vessel they use :)

I will be back to announce the new chapters.
