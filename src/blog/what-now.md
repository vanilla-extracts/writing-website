# What now? It's empty 
## Work, life {#work}
Like I said in my most recent (as of today) blog post on my [main blog](https://www.charlotte-thomas.me/blog) work kept me very busy pretty much all through April and early May.

Now I started work (for real) and it will reflect on my time to do writing stuff.

## Are you disappearing? Certainly feels that way {#disappearing} 

I'm not! Just taking a step back for the time being, I need to get the rope of my work first and I need to be good at it! 

I *want* to see **Galactic Consequences** see the light of day and it will! However long it may be.

## State {#state}
The State of things hardly changed. I'm still 60% of the way up to the first draft of Chapter VI of *GC* and have the first three chapters of the short story done.


I will be back, just give me time.

Love,

Cheers,

Charlotte.
