# An Update

## My life {#life}
Life has been... Hectic. These past few weeks. You may notice (or not if, *no
one* is reading this blog, which very well may be the case) I haven't posted an
update in a month, almost to the day.

I've been busy, with life, work, friends and family. The holidays are not the
happiest time of the year to be honest. 

## My work {#work}
Don't be afraid! I haven't gave up on the book! It will be writen.
My muse lately has been very star-trekky and I've been more active in my RP
rather than working on the book, but the wind will change and with it my muse
will turn to _Galactic Consequences_.

I'm still targeting mid 2026 as a release date for the whole
book. Because life will get **crazy busy** mid 2025 to end of 2025 because I'll
put a downpayment on an *apartment* and will buy one! Very exciting but at the
same time... frightening!

## Sneak peak {#sneak}
I couldn't let you off the hook without a _sneak peak_ could I? Unfortunately
not of _Chapter IV: Revelations_ because it... isn't written yet and the little
that is may change drastically in the edited version.

So enjoy a little look at _Chapter III: Encounter_ :).
