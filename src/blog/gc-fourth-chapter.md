# Fourth chapter finished and edited 

## Fourth chapter {#fourth}
The fourth chapter, _Chapter IV: Revelation_, is finished, and edited. I sent it to the
alpha-readers for their thoughts on it. 

It took a while! Almost a month and a half, but I had writer's block! 

My favourite quote of the chapter

> Aendir looked uneasy, and sighed “… Okay you can come, but we’re staying on Earth!”

It officially marks the 25% completion of the book, with 4 chapters out of 16.
This is exciting!

Stay tuned for _Chapter V: Exploration_ (yeah you can guess the quote won't stay
true with a chapter name like this can you?)

## Writer's block {#writer}
So, why was I having a case of writer's block? I don't know, my muse was
cooperating with my Star Trek RP but I needed more than a month of rest before
being able to take the quill and attack this chapter.

I am quite happy with how it turned out and I managed to hyperfix and
worldbuild with my partner so we have an entire race of	_mysterious_ beings with
a backstory. 

I'm not revealing who are they though you'll have to wait for the chapter to be
released!
