These past few weeks. You may notice (or not if, <em>no one</em> is reading this blog, which very well may be the case) I haven’t posted an update in a month, almost to the day.</p><p>I’ve been busy, with life, work, friends and family. The holidays are not the happiest time of the year to be honest.</p><h2 id=work><a href=#work class=anchor></a>My work</h2><p>Don’t be afraid! I haven’t gave up on the book! It will be writen. My muse lately has been very star-trekky and I’ve been more active in my RP rather than working on the book, but the wind will change and with it my muse will turn to <em>Galactic Consequences</em>.</p><p>I’m still targeting mid 2026 as a release date for the whole book. Because life will get <strong>crazy busy</strong> mid 2025 to end of 2025 because I’ll put a downpayment on an <em>apartment</em> and will buy one! Very exciting but at the same time… frightening!</p><h2 id=sneak><a href=#sneak class=anchor></a>Sneak peak</h2><p>I couldn’t let you off the hook without a <em>sneak peak</em> could I? Unfortunately not of <em>Chapter IV: Revelations</em> because it… isn’t written yet and the little that is may change drastically in the edited version.</p><p>So enjoy a little look at <em>Chapter III: Encounter</em> :).</p><blockquote><p>Hey, hon, don’t frustrate yourself, this happens when you try to design a single-stage-to-orbit FTL vessel. It’s science fiction.</p></blockquote><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
