I am already around 2,500 words on it and I haven’t written like half of it. So I accepted that this chapter was going to be a chonky boi, as such it will have a chonky deadline (this is totally an excuse to report the deadline, I’m the writer and you’re not even reading this so who cares right?)</p><p>I think I’ll be done by the end of March. And Hopefully I can do Chapter VI in April.</p><h2 id=irl><a href=#irl class=anchor></a>Status IRL</h2><p>May will be a big month, I’m moving halfway accross the country for my next (and hopefully permanent) assignement with my job. I’ll start doing my job as a DevOps Engineer (which is a cool name to say a whole lot of nothing) there.</p><p>I don’t think I will be able to write much in May. But I think I’ll have Chapter VII in the works to be finished in June.</p><h2 id=roadmap><a href=#roadmap class=anchor></a>Roadmap</h2><p>From there it’s just a matter of finishing the Chapters VIII to XVI, and the epilogue, and like I said earlier in another post, from there it will be editors, alpha readers, and all that jazzy stuff.</p><p>I’m <em>very</em> not ready to announce a date and I don’t even <em>want</em> to. Because it’d pressure myself; and thus no date announced, it will happen when it happens.</p><h2 id=sp><a href=#sp class=anchor></a>Sneakpeak</h2><p>Ok I’m not a monster I will give you a good quote from the first part of Chapter V, not my <em>favourite</em> because on the off-chance someone reads this blog. First of all thank you? Really I thought this was my blog and mine alone so wow. Cool.</p><p>Right, on the off-chance someone is reading this I don’t want them to be spoiled of the delight of reading my favourite sentence in the chapter, but enjoy a sneakpeak.</p><blockquote><p>“I know what he said, but I’m sure we could… convince him.” they said, looking positively guilty.</p></blockquote><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/writing-website class=no_underline><img alt="GitHub Logo"height=24 src=/static/github.svg width=auto></a><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
