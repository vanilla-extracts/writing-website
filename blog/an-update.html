The company filed for bankruptcy not long after the creation of the ER and the state providing apartments, homes, and furniture. The IP of the shark was now owned by a non-profit mostly run by Trans folx, they sold the plushies and derivatives at a much better price, and in different sizes too. Beth must have bought her the plushy to cheer her up. And it was working, she smiled softly.</p></blockquote><h2 id=language><a href=#language class=anchor></a>Multi-language support</h2><p>I feel confident enough to modify the <code class=scode>rust</code> code which builds the static website to implement multi language support. It won’t be implemented here, the book is in English, so no sense having a website in French. But it will be useful for my <a href=https://www.charlotte-thomas.me>website</a> which also use SJ’s framework.</p><p>I opened a tracking <a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/website/issues/2>issue</a> on my repo of my website if you want to follow it!</p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/writing-website class=no_underline><img alt="GitHub Logo"height=24 src=/static/github.svg width=auto></a><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
