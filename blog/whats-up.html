Is two chapters out of five done. These are smaller chapters, a little above a thousand words a chapter, contrast to GC chapter which are about three thousands words a chapter. I just finished chapter two today.</p><h2 id=future><a href=#future class=anchor></a>The immediate future</h2><p>On the immediate future, May will probably be a complete write-off, between the move, the new assignment at my job, and my anxiety.</p><p>But I <em>should</em> be able to finish <em>Chapter VI: Fugitives</em> of GC by mid June, again, no promise, but I should be able to. Again, like the others I’ll send it to my beta readers and start on <em>Chapter VII</em> (not gonna title drop ;)).</p><p>In the meantime I’ll finish <em>Roommates</em> and send it up to some friends for beta reading and then publish it on the usual suspects (so, SH, RR, AO3, and maybe here if I <em>finally</em> finished the online reader).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Charlotte.</p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/writing-website class=no_underline><img alt="GitHub Logo"height=24 src=/static/github.svg width=auto></a><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
