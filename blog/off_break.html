However, I am starting work again (part time) in January, and with that I will start writing again.</p><p>The break was important for my mental and physical health.</p><h2 id=you><a href=#you class=anchor></a>What the hell is wrong with you</h2><p>I have multiple chronic illnesses, including CFS caused by Long EBV and Long COVID, and I have mental health issues, I was focusing on getting better so I could work again.</p><p>The holidays have been good for me, and I’m looking forward to start working again. I have so many ideas for the book and how to improve it, I even have sketches of the vessel used by our protagonists, the <em>Union Science Ship AIX-09</em> I will include these sketches at the end of this article. They are merely concept sketches for my head to concentrate, I have aphantasia and thus I am unable to form voluntary mental images, so I had to get on paper. Unfortunately, I am a scientist and not a skilled artist, so they are simple.</p><h2 id=gc><a href=#gc class=anchor></a>Galactic Consequences</h2><p>I will start writing <em>Galactic Consequences</em> again, and will try to focus and avoid branching on different stories, I already wrote two short stories on the same setting and I would really like to finish the first draft mid-2026. We’ll see if I am able to do that.</p><p>I will start by editing what I already wrote to correct the descriptions of the ship to correlate to the sketches I made. And another round of editing will not hurt as well. When I have finished I will start by resuming Chapter VIII. There are fifteen chapters in total so I am about halfway through the first draft, and I edit as I write.</p><p>I hope to have news for you (read: finishing chapter VIII) by the middle of February, finishing in January will be tough as I have many medical visits literally at opposite cities in my country.</p><h2 id=sketches><a href=#sketches class=anchor></a>Concept Sketches</h2><p><a href=/static/concept_sketch_lateral_view.jpg><img alt="Lateral View"src=/static/concept_sketch_lateral_view.jpg></a></p><p><a href=/static/concept_sketch_top_view.jpg><img alt="Top View"src=/static/concept_sketch_top_view.jpg></a></p><h2 id=afterwords><a href=#afterwords class=anchor></a>Afterwords</h2><p>I hope you enjoy those sneak peaks at the vessel they use :)</p><p>I will be back to announce the new chapters.</p><p>Charlotte Thomas.</p><p><em>P.S: I finally changed the RSS Feed to the new domain.</em></p><p class=back><a href=#>⮬ Back to top</a></p></main><footer class=center><a href=https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/writing-website class=no_underline><img alt="GitHub Logo"src=/static/github.svg height=24 width=auto></a><p>Kind regards to Sabrina Jewson for the templates and static generator, go see her <a href=https://sabrinajewson.org>website</a></p></footer></body></html>
